## Getting started

If you don't have a webserver where you can set-up an API. Go to https://www.mockapi.io/. Create an account. Make a new project and give it a new what you would like. Next, leave the API prefix empty. After that you can hit the create button.

When you created the API. Click on edit and go down to *schema*. Make sure the schema looks like this:

| Name          | Type          | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| id            | object-id     | 
| title         | string        |
| description   | string        |

Scroll down and click on the *update button*. Fill the API with data.

If you have your API filled with data you only need to set in the code the right URL's.
